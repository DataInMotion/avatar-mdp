# MDP Evaluation Tests

To launch these tests you would need the suggester models. 

These are quite heavy and could not be uploaded to gitHub.

So, you would need to download first the `mdp_suggesters.zip` archive in the dim drive (if you do not have permission to do that, please ask).

Once you have downloaded the file, unzip it and place the content of the `suggester` folder inside your `data` folder in this test bundle. 

**DO NOT TRY TO CHECK IN THE DATA FOLDER IN GITHUB!!**
